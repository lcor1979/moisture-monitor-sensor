The sensor is totaly wireless (use a LIPO battery which can be charged witgh the Feather's USB port).

(pictures will be added later)

It uses GATT attributes to publish the measures.

https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/gatt

Sent attributes are :
- One notify attribute indicating a new measure is available
- Three read attributes for : battery (in percent), humidity (in percent), temperature (in Â°C)

The code contains two projects :

- One to initialize the GATT attributes and GAP informations. It should be ran only once on the device.
- One to run the logic which should be uploaded to the Feather after the initialisation has been done.

Code could be run in Arduino IDE : https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
